WeaponDescription=Special: Universal\nThe P-700 "Granit"(NATO reporting name: SS-N-19 Shipwreck) is a Russian naval anti-ship/land-attack cruise missile. It comes in surface-to-surface and submarine-launched variants. It was designed in the 1970s to replace the P-70 Amethyst and P-120 Malakhit, both effective missiles but with too short a range in the face of improving weapons of U.S. Navy carrier battlegroups. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between ship-attack and land-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.

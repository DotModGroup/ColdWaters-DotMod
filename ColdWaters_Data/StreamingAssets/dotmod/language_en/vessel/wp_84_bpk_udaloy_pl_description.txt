[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Udaloy
Description=Udaloy-class Large Anti-Submarine Ship
Aircraft=2 Ka-27 Helix ASW helicopter
History=The most recent class of large anti-submarine ship, the Udaloy is optimized for ASW to the extent that it no longer features an area-defence SAM system. Compared to the earlier BPK's, these ships feature the larger Horse Jaw bow sonar and Horse Tail variable-depth sonar also found on the Kirov. This in conjunction with their elaborate command and control facilities and the ability to operate twice the number of helicopters make them formidable opponents.

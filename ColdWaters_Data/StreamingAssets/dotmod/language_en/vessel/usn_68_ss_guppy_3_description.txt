ShipClass=GUPPY III
Description=GUPPY III Diesel-Electric Submarine Conversion
History=All boats converted to GUPPY III were originally WWII-era fleet submarines converted to the GUPPY II project. Unfortunately, that project suffered from severely cramped internal conditions, as all four of the fleet boats' original engines remained installed in the submarines, and no other measures were taken to ensure that the crew would be given adequate accommodations with all of the space now taken up by the new equipment. GUPPY III was created, ostensibly, to address these cramped conditions. Firstly, each boat was lengthened. Then, the sonar equipment was moved to this new space, and upgraded. Each boat would receive the PUFFS (Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System) BQG-4 sonar system, consisting of 3 shark-like fins placed along the submarine. The system was designed to assist in passive target ranging alongside standard bearing-only Target Motion Analysis. Though the project failed this goal the sonar system remained installed on the boats. The boats were also given the BQS-4 active sonar set and BQR-2 passive hull set. In addition, the conversions were given the new Mark 101 Torpedo Fire Control System and Mark 37 Director. These fire-control upgrades would allow these submarines to carry and use the wire-guided Mark 37 Mod 1/2 and Mark 45 torpedoes. Depending on each boat's exact configuration, top speed varied, but as converted most could make a top speed of 17.2 knots on the surface and 14.5 knots underwater on batteries for approximately 30 minutes.

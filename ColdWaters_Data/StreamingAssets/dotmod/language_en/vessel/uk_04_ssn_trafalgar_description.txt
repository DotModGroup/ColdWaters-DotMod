Description=Trafalgar-class Nuclear Attack Submarine (2000s)
History=The Trafalgar class were designed in the early 1970s during the Cold War as a refinement of the preceding Swiftsure class. Including HMS Dreadnought, the Trafalgar class are the fifth class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines to enter service with the Royal Navy. The first of the class, HMS Trafalgar, was ordered on 7 April 1977 and completed in 1983. The last, HMS Triumph, was ordered on 3 January 1986 and completed in 1991. All seven boats of the class were built and completed by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard.\n\nIn the 2000s the final 4 boats of the Trafalgar-class received an additional upgrade to extend their lives and provide derisking to the in development Astute-class. This primarily consisted of a new command system and the fitment of the Sonar 2076 integrated suite that was later to be fitted to the Astute-class.

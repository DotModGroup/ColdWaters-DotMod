[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Sturgeon
Description=Sturgeon-class Nuclear Attack Submarine (Early)
History=In service since 1967, this class formed the backbone of US attack submarines during the cold war until the mid-80's. Stealthy, manueverable and with an excellent sonar suite, these boats can match up to any but the very latest Soviet boats. Their only drawback is their comparatively low speed.

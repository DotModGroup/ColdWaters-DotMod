Description=Nautilus-class Nuclear Attack Submarine
History=After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the USN received several of Germany's Type XXI U-boats, the most advanced submarines on the planet. Very quickly it was discovered they were far more capable than anything the Allied Powers possessed, and efforts to reverse engineer them began in several nations. The Soviet Union built 215 Whiskey-class submarines, which were very similar to the Type XXI. The US back fitted technology into its diesel-electric fleet boats, and set out to make the most advanced submarine on the planet - the Nautilus. The boat was laid down in 1952 as the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, and took advantage of captured German technology, such as the snorkel. Upon entering service in 1955, she very quickly proved that she was worth the cost by making a voyage to the geographical North Pole in August of 1958, and continuously outperformed NATO ASW units in exercises. But as time went on, she steadily became inferior to her successors and was decommissioned in 1980. Today she is a museum ship in Groton, Connecticut.

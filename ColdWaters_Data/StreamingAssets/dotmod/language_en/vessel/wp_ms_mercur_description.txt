ShipClass=Merchant
Description=Large container ship
History=These are first-generation container ships, with cargo capacity of about 1900 TEU. Compared to traditional break-bulk cargo ships, containerization enabled these ships to be loaded with a full complement of cargo in a fraction of the time, using much smaller dock crews. They would eventually completely replace the dry cargo ship, to become the predominant type of cargo vessel.

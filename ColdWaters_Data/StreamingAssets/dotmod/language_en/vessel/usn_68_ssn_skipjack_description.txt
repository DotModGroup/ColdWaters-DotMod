[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Skipjack
Description=Skipjack-class Nuclear Attack Submarine (Early)
History=In service since 1959, the Skipjacks were the first attack submarines to feature the revolutionary teardrop hull and single-hull construction with a single shaft. Though they have been refitted with quieter propellers and towed arrays, these boats are designed for high speed and lack the silencing and advanced sonars introduced in later classes. One member of this class, the USS Scorpion, sank with all hands near the Azores in 1968.

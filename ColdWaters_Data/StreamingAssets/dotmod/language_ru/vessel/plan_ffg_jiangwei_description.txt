History=The Jiangwei is a much more capable follow-on design to the earlier Jianghu frigate, featuring a 6-cell SAM launcher on the foredeck, along with improved radar-controlled 37mm guns that offer anti-missile capability. The missile battery is larger, featuring six box launchers in two groups of three, which carry the YJ-83 anti-ship missile or CY-1 anti-submarine missile. Additional ASW weaponry comprise extended-range ASW mortars, and launchers for ASW torpedoes. A hangar and helipad provide these ships with ASW helicopter capability. Along with the larger Luhu destroyer, these ships make up the 'high end' of the PLAN's high/low mix.

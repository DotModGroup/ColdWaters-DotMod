ShipClass=Belknap
Description=Belknap-class Guided Missile Cruiser (Early)
Aircraft=1 SH-2F Seasprite
History=This class was built in the 1960's as fast single-ended guided missile frigates for screening carrier taskforces. The design is derivative of the earlier Leahy-class double-ended taskforce frigates, but substitutes the rear missile launcher for a 5-inch gun, along with an upgraded missile system capable of firing both the Standard surface-to-air missile and the ASROC anti-submarine missile. They were reclassified as guided missile cruisers in 1975.

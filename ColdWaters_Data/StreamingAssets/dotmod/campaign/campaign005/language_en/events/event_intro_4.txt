Sentence1=International outrage as the Soviet Air Force shoots down a second Korean Airlines aircraft. Unlike KAL-902 in 1978 which made a successful crash landing (pictured) all 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed. The Politburo issued a statement, claiming that flight KAL-007 was on a spy mission on behalf of the United States. "We regard this a deliberate provocation to test our military preparedness, or even an attempt to provoke a war" the Soviet Minister of Defence said.

Sentence2=Tensions between the First and Second Worlds are now elevated to a degree not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Overall military readiness is heightened, as NATO exercises in the Pacific and Atlantic are denounced by the Soviet Union as "deliberate imperialist provocations".

[MISSION WIN]
Command is glad to hear that the deployment went off without a hitch. Let's hope the team won't let us down, and that the SOSUS line will get knocked out.
[MISSION FAIL]
Failures of this magnatude are unacceptable. Upon your return to port, we expect a detailed report on why this mission has failed.
[MISSION MISSED]
Your failure to transit from <STARTLOCATION> to <ENDLOCATION> in the alloted time frame is raising questions about your suitibility as a submarine captain.

Title=<b>SOVIETS CAPTURE<n>SUB CREW</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=Soviet spokesmen claim to have captured the surviving crew, along with the commanding officer, of a US nuclear powered attack submarine. While they refuse to reveal the exact location and way the crew members were captured, Soviet knowledge of operational details clearly confirms the accuracy of their claim. They also claim that "All prisoners have been, and will continue to be, treated in accordance with the laws of war."

Sentence2=Concerns have been raised regarding Soviet treatment of war prisoners. Disturbing reports suggest that significant numbers of officers and enlisted men have been subjected to torture, tried as war criminals or executed. Countless more have allegedly been interned at numerous Gulag labor camps throughout the Soviet Union. The fate of thousands of unaccounted NATO troops and non-combatants will likely not be confirmed until hostilities cease.

[MISSION FAIL]
Discouraged to hear you lost this chance against such a high priority target. We won't get many opportunities like this.

Discouraged to hear you lost this opportunity against such a high priority target. Better luck next time. Enemy presence in this area will likely hinder Atlantic operations. New orders will be sent after reassessment of enemy capabilities and assumed intent.

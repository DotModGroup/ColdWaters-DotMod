[SONAR]
usn_an_bqr_2=AN/BQR-2=Derived from the German wartime GHG sonar suite as fitted on the Type XXI electroboot, the BQR-2 is a medium frequency sonar fitted to most USN subs until the Thresher/Permit class.

usn_an_bqr_21=AN/BQR-21=This is an updated version of the BQR-2 boasting new digital data processing for much better performance.
usn_an_bqs_4=AN/BQS-4=This system formed the active component of the sonar suite on 1950's era USN subs. Unlike the BQR-2 though, it is still powerful enough to detect otherwise silent enemies.
usn_an_bqq_2=AN/BQQ-2=The first spherical integrated sonar array, mounted in the Permit- and Sturgeon class submarines.
usn_an_bqq_5=AN/BQQ-5=This advanced sonar suite uses a spherical array with the latest digital signal processing techniques and was first introduced in the Los Angeles-class fast attack submarines, and subsequently to the Permit and Sturgeon classes where it replaced the analog BQQ-2 spherical array.

usn_tb_16=TB-16=The TB-16 Towed Array greatly increases the range of passive sonar. It is most effective at slower speeds but suffers from noise saturation above 10 Kts.\n \nThe Towed Array also negates the stern blind arc that is caused by ownship noise.
usn_tb_23=TB-23=The TB-23 Thin-Line Towed Array greatly increases the range of passive sonar. It is most effective at slower speeds but suffers from noise saturation above 10 Kts.\n \nThe Towed Array also negates the stern blind arc that is caused by ownship noise.

usn_sqs_56=SQS-56=The AN/SQS-56 is a modern hull-mounted sonar found on Perry-class frigates which features digital implementation, system control by a built-in mini computer, and an advanced display system. Computer controlled functions provide a system that is extremely flexible and easy to operate. The computer is also used to provide automated fault detection and localization with a built-in training capability. The sonar is an active/passive, preformed beam, digital sonar providing panoramic echo ranging and panoramic (DIMUS) passive surveillance. A single operator can search, track, classify and designate multiple targets from the active system while simultaneously maintaining anti-torpedo surveillance on the passive display.

usn_sqr_18=SQR-18=The SQR-18 TACTASS greatly increases the range of passive sonar. It is most effective at slower speeds but suffers from noise saturation above 10 Kts.\n \nThe Towed Array also negates the stern blind arc that is caused by ownship noise.

wp_bull_nose=Bull Nose=This is a medium-frequency passive/active array dating from the late 1960's.

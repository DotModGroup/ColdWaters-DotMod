ShipClass=Kilo
Description=Kilo-class Diesel-Electric Submarine (1984)
History=This is the latest and most advanced diesel-electric submarine built by the Soviets.

It is also much quieter, and carries weapons and sensors on par with the third-generation nuclear attack submarines like the Victor III.

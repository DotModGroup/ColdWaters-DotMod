History=These are the last big-gun warships built after WWII during 1950s. Although obsolete with the advent of anti-ship missiles and jet aircraft, the Soviets still consider them useful for providing artillery support during amphibious operations, and several of the class have been upgraded to serve as flagships in surface strike groups, their large size providing for extensive radar equipment as well as command and control facilities. They could also find use as convoy raiders if allowed to break into the North Atlantic convoy lanes.

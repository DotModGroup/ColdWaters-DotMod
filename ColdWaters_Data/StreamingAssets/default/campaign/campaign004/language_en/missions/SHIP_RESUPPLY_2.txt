[MISSION WIN]
Excellent work in finding and destroying the enemies UNREP ships. Continue future operations with the same gutso!
[MISSION FAIL]
Command is dissapointed in your failure. The fact that you were unable to deal with unarmed supply ships is bewildering.
[MISSION MISSED]
The supply ships have replenished enemy surface combatants and left the area. The oppertunity has passed.

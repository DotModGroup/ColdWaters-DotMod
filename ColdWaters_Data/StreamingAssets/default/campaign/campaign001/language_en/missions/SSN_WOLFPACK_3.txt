[MISSION WIN]
Very pleased to see that you dealt with those subs with determination and resolve, Commander! Remember that for every enemy vessel we take out, it means a safer transit for our troops and transports. Good work.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear you failed to intercept the enemy. Expect better hunting from you next time.

History=At its introduction in 1962, the Kashin was the world's first warship class powered entirely by gas turbine drive. The ship has the classic double-ended armament layout typical of Soviet ships of the period, with the anti-submarine armament comprising guided torpedoes and anti-submarine rockets. Advanced for their time, by the 1980's these now obsolescent ships make 'low' ships in a naval group using a 'high-low' mix.
